The bot asks who you would like to challenge and would ask you to insert their Discord tag.
After you put the other player’s discord tag, the bot asks you how much you would like to wager.
You insert whatever dollar amount
The bot continues to ask whatever questions are assigned to the game mode that was previously selected from the #wagers channel.
The bot goes to the challenged player’s dms and sends them all of the supplied info and it tells them if they accept the wager say yes and if they decline the wager say no
and then if they say yes, the bot finishes asking the second user questions and creates a text channel with the two players and the match host along with each user’s answers to each question
